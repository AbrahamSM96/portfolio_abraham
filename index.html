          <h1>The Day My Mother Forgot to Cry</h1>
          <p>I shudder to recall that dreadful Diwali night of October 2007, when my mother knocked our bed room at the dead of the night enquiring where the toilet was. She looked disoriented and totally confused. Unable to understand the cause for her abnormal behaviour, we thought she was still in a semi-sleep state and showed her the toilet. But even after coming out of toilet she was unable to find her way to her bed room.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <div class="p fixed">Sensing that something is seriously amiss, we took her next day to the nearby nursing home for diagnosis and treatment. She was immediately referred to a neurosurgeon and after a MRI scan it was confirmed that she suffered a brain stroke. The report showed certain grey patches which the doctor referred to as clots have affected her memory totally. The doctor informed that the memory loss is irreversible due to her old age. He, however, assured that further, damage to the brain can be arrested with drugs.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <div class="p fixed">That was the beginning of the slow end for my mother. As the disease got worsened, she forgot everything. Lost control of her body functions and finally, failed to recognize anyone except my wife who used to take care of her like a mother taking care of her baby. She used to feed her, change her diapers, dress her, give her bath, brush her hair, and also help her to sleep.</div>
